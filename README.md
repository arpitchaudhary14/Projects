Banking System Project (Python):
 About the Project:
This is a simple Banking System simulation project created fully using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The goal of this project is to simulate basic banking operations like:

Account Creation

Deposit Money

Withdraw Money

Balance Inquiry

Display Full Account Details

Exit System

Tech Stack Used:
Language: Python 3.x

Concepts:

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Methods)

Console-based User Interface

Conditionals, Loops, Functions

Key Learnings:
Proper class structure designing

Function decomposition

Data encapsulation via class attributes

Real-world problem simulation using object-oriented design

User interaction through terminal-based interface

Limitations:
No file handling or database — all data stored in-memory.

Data resets on program exit.

No GUI — purely console-based system.

Account search by ID

Transaction history management
